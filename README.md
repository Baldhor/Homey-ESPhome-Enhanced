ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems.

ESP8266's and ESP32's are widely available on webshops and Aliexpress for a few bucks and can be used to read sensors like temperature, humidity, CO2, PM2.5 but also motion detection measuring current and/or power.
They can also be used to control motors, relais, light strips, displays, touch sensors, fans etc.
Since they have bluetooth they can also be used as presence detection, read Xiaomi temperature/humidity sensors or even the Xiaomi weighing scale!
The possibilities are endless!
