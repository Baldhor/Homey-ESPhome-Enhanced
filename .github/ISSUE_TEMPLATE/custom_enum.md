title: '[Custom Enum Request] xxx'

**Reminder**
Homey doesn't support dynamic capability for 'list of values'.
Every 'list of values' (enumeration) require a specific implementation!
It takes about 10 minutes to do it correctly and imply support in case fix are needed.
It also means that I need to maintain all those custom enum in the long term!

This is discussed in details here: https://github.com/Baldhor/Homey-ESPhome-Enhanced/wiki/Custom-capabilities

**Pay for a Service**
The idea here is not to sell my service for a price, but more likely to say "**Hey, you own me a beer!**".
> Drinking alcohol is bad for your health, ask for help :)

Jump to my paypal and offer me a beer: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/baldhors
> Price for a beer in France is about 6â‚¬ ...

**Implemented for you, but available for ALL**
The custom enum you request will benefit everyone that may have the same need!
Little by little, the list could cover 90% of everyone needs.
> Meaning, no more beer for me in the medium term :(

**Custom enum requested**
Detail here the custom enum you need!
Include a 'collect debug info' file, you can obtain it through the page 'Manage your physical devices' page.
